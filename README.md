# AgriRecoNet: Agricultural Recommendation Network üåæ

A clean, reproducible benchmark for the classic **Crop Recommendation** problem. This project implements and evaluates multiple machine learning baselines and a deep learning model to predict the optimal crop based on environmental and soil features.

## ‚ú® Highlights

This repository provides an end-to-end, ready-to-run solution for crop recommendation.

-   **Comprehensive EDA:** Includes visualizations like a correlation heatmap to understand feature relationships.
-   **Multiple Baselines:** Compares classic ML models: **Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost**.
-   **Deep Learning Model:** Features a custom **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built with TensorFlow/Keras.
-   **Thorough Evaluation:** Assesses models using accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices, and ROC/AUC curves.
-   **Reproducible Environment:** Comes with a `requirements.txt` file for easy setup.

## üì¶ Dataset

The model is trained on the **Crop Recommendation Dataset**, which contains the following features:

-   **Soil Nutrients:** Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), Potassium (K)
-   **Soil Condition:** pH value
-   **Environmental Factors:** Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall

The target variable is the recommended crop label (e.g., Rice, Maize, Chickpea, etc.).

**To Use:**
The notebook is configured to load `Crop_recommendation.csv` from a `data/` directory.

1.  Create a folder named `data` in the root of the project.
2.  Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset) and place it inside the `data/` folder.
3.  Alternatively, update the path in the "Data Load" cell of the notebook to your specific file location.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Run

Get up and running in a few simple steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/AgriRecoNet.git](https://github.com/meanderinghuman/AgriRecoNet.git)
    cd AgriRecoNet
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # Create the environment
    python -m venv .venv

    # Activate it (Linux/Mac)
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Activate it (Windows)
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Launch the notebook:**
    Open the `AgriRecoNet.ipynb` notebook in VS Code or Jupyter and run the cells.
    * **In VS Code:** Ensure you have the Python and Jupyter extensions installed. Select the `.venv` interpreter from the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).

## üß≠ Roadmap

Future enhancements planned for this project:

-   [ ] Implement hyperparameter tuning sweeps (Optuna/Scikit-Optimize).
-   [ ] Integrate cross-validation with stratification for more robust evaluation.
-   [ ] Add model explainability using **SHAP** across all models.
-   [ ] Create a script to export the best-performing model as a saved artifact for deployment.

## üìå Notes

-   **TensorFlow Errors:** If you encounter GPU errors with TensorFlow, try running on a CPU or ensure you have the correct CUDA/cuDNN versions installed for your hardware.
-   **XGBoost:** This library is optional. If you face installation issues, you can comment out the XGBoost-related cells in the notebook.
